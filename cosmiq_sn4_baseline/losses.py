def weighted_bce(y_true, y_pred, weight):
    """Weighted binary cross-entropy for Keras.

    Arguments:
    ----------
    y_true (tensor): passed silently by Keras during model training.
    y_pred (tensor): passed silently by Keras during model training.
    weight (numeric): Weight to assign to mask foreground pixels. Use values
        >1 to over-weight foreground or 0<value<1 to under-weight foreground.
        weight=1 is identical to vanilla binary cross-entropy.

    Returns:
    --------
    The binary cross-entropy loss function output multiplied by a weighting
    mask.

    Usage:
    ------
    Because Keras doesn't make it easy to implement loss functions that
    take arguments beyond `y_true` and `y_pred`, this function's arguments
    must be partially defined before passing it into your `model.compile`
    command. See example below, modified from ternausnet.py:

    ```
    model = Model(input=inputs, output=output_layer) # defined in ternausnet.py

    loss_func = partial(weighted_bce, weight=loss_weight)
    loss_func = update_wrapper(loss_func, weighted_bce)

    model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss=loss_func)
    ```

    If you wish to save and re-load a model which used this loss function,
    you must pass the loss function as a custom object:

    ```
    model.save('path_to_your_model.hdf5')
    wbce_loss = partial(weighted_bce, weight=loss_weight)
    wbce_loss = update_wrapper(wbce_loss, weighted_bce)
    reloaded_model = keras.models.load_model(
        'path_to_your_model.hdf5', custom_objects={'weighted_bce': wbce_loss}
        )
    ```

    Usage:
    ------
    See implementation instructions for `weighted_bce`.

    This loss function is intended to allow different weighting of different
    segmentation outputs - for example, if a model outputs a 3D image mask,
    where the first channel corresponds to foreground objects and the second
    channel corresponds to object edges. `weights` must be a list of length
    equal to the depth of the output mask. The output mask's "z-axis"
    corresponding to the mask channel must be the third axis in the output
    array.
